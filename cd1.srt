1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,151
<i>I killed Sirius Black!</i>

2
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,319
<i>He's back.</i>

3
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,034
<i>The police are</i>
<i>continuing with the investigation...</i>

4
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,156
<i>... into the cause</i>
<i>of the Millennium Bridge disaster.</i>

5
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,869
<i>Traffic has been halted</i>
<i>as police search for survivors.</i>

6
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,632
<i>The surrounding area remains closed.</i>

7
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,837
<i>The mayor has urged Londoners</i>
<i>to remain calm...</i>

8
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,155
"Harry Potter."

9
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,232
Who's Harry Potter?

10
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,631
Oh, no one.

11
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,479
Bit of a tosser, really.

12
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,472
Funny, that paper of yours.

13
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,154
Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

14
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,993
- Really?
- Thought I was going around the twist.

15
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,837
- Hey, I was wondering...
- Eleven. That's when I get off.

16
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,673
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.

17
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,630
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.

18
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,995
I like riding around on trains.

19
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,030
Takes my mind off things.

20
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,311
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?

21
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,677
The tale is thrilling, 
if I say so myself.

22
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,274
But now is not the time to tell it.

23
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,953
Take my arm.

24
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,672
Do as I say.

25
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,833
I just Apparated, didn't I?

26
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,037
Indeed. Quite successfully too,
I might add.

27
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,714
Most people vomit the first time.

28
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,552
I can't imagine why.

29
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,555
Welcome to the
charming village of Budleigh Babberton.

30
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,838
Harry, I assume, right about now, you're
wondering why I brought you here.

31
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,638
Am I right?

32
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,031
Actually, sir, after all these years,
I just sort of go with it.

33
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,158
Wands out, Harry.

34
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,519
Horace?

35
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,513
Horace?

36
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,873
Merlin's beard!

37
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,195
No need to disfigure me, Albus.

38
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,909
Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

39
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,032
It's all in the upholstery. I come by the
stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

40
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,752
Dragon's blood.

41
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,152
- Oh.
- Oh, yes, introductions.

42
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,154
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine...

43
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,719
...Horace Slughorn.

44
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,313
Horace...

45
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,153
...well, you know who this is.

46
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,910
Harry Potter.

47
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,312
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?

48
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,835
You weren't, by any chance,
waiting for someone else?

49
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,355
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

50
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,110
All right, the Death Eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.

51
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,554
Do you know what that's like?

52
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,315
You can only say no so many times, so
I never stay anywhere more than a week.

53
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,716
Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.

54
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,556
Well, I think we should put it back
in order for them, don't you? Mind.

55
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,558
That was fun.

56
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,398
- Do you mind if I use the loo?
- No, of course.

57
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,240
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.

58
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,679
The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.

59
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,711
You're very like your father.

60
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,553
- Except for the eyes. You have your...
- My mother's eyes. Yeah.

61
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,269
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.

62
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,637
Even more impressive when one
considers she was Muggle-born.

63
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,268
One of my best friends is Muggle-born.
Best in our year.

64
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,396
Please don't think I'm prejudiced.
No, no.

65
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,599
Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.

66
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,478
Right at the front.

67
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,473
All mine. Each and every one.

68
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,631
Ex-students, I mean.

69
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,998
You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,
editor of <i>The Daily Prophet.</i>

70
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,229
Always takes my owl,
should I wish to register an opinion...

71
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,628
...on the news of the day.

72
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,313
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

73
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,835
Free tickets whenever I want them.

74
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,878
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.

75
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,999
Ah, yes.

76
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,230
Regulus Black.

77
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,188
You no doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.

78
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,794
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.

79
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,076
It's a shame. Talented boy.

80
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,314
I got Regulus when he came along,
of course, but I'd have liked the set.

81
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,309
Horace?

82
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,479
Do you mind if I take this?

83
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,355
- I do love knitting patterns.
- Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?

84
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,512
I think I know a lost cause
when I see one. Regrettable.

85
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,875
I would have considered it
a personal triumph...

86
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,873
...had you consented to return
to Hogwarts. Oh, well.

87
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,918
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here,
one of a kind.

88
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,158
Well, bye-bye, Horace.

89
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,388
Bye.

90
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,359
All right. I'll do it.

91
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,911
But I want Professor Merrythought's old
office, not the water closet I had before.

92
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,119
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!

93
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,398
They are indeed.

94
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,477
Sir, exactly what was all that about?

95
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,511
You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.

96
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,956
Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

97
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,395
You would be his crowning jewel.

98
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,873
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial he should return.

99
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,552
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

100
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,555
She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.

101
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,030
It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow,
make some excuse.

102
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,715
Oh, you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

103
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,758
But, sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?

104
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,480
Both are waiting for you.

105
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,079
Hedwig.

106
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,754
Mum?

107
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,399
Ginny, what is it?

108
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,950
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.

109
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,237
- What? Harry? Harry who?
- Harry Potter, of course.

110
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,437
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?

111
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,956
- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
- No, dear, I seriously doubt that.

112
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,072
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?

113
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,117
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

114
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,192
Of course not. I'd know if my best friend
was in my room, wouldn't I?

115
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,749
- Is that an owl?
- You haven't seen him, have you?

116
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,592
He's wandering about the house.

117
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,432
- Really?
- Really.

118
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,193
Harry!

119
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,798
Harry!

120
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,469
Hello.

121
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,791
What a lovely surprise.

122
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,030
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?

123
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,919
- I didn't know. Dumbledore.
- Oh, that man.

124
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,230
But then, what would we do
without him?

125
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,000
Got a bit of toothpaste.

126
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,273
So when did you get here?

127
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,078
A few days ago.

128
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,190
Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

129
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,115
Mum sort of lost it last week.

130
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,119
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts.

131
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,599
That it's too dangerous.

132
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,479
- Oh, come on.
- She's not alone.

133
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,837
Even my parents, and they're Muggles,
know something bad's happening.

134
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,709
Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy...

135
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,309
...and it took a few days,
but she came around.

136
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,354
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?

137
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,072
There's been a lot of talk recently that...

138
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,438
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.

139
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,318
Rubbish! Well, he's only...

140
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,993
What is he?

141
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,232
Hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.

142
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,155
Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!

143
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,719
The Dark Lord trusts him.

144
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,316
- The Dark Lord's mistaken.
- Pfft.

145
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,550
Run along, Wormtail.

146
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,834
I know I ought not to be here.

147
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,559
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

148
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,280
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.

149
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,513
Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.

150
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,029
As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

151
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,315
You?

152
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,555
The Dark Lord told you?

153
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,554
Your sister doubts me.

154
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,279
Understandable. Over the years
I've played my part well.

155
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,035
So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.

156
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,154
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.

157
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,151
I don't doubt you, Severus.

158
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,357
You should be honored, Cissy.
As should Draco.

159
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,397
He's just a boy.

160
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,118
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.

161
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,195
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.

162
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,678
- Severus.
- Swear to it.

163
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,909
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

164
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,552
It's just empty words.

165
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,792
He'll give it his best effort.

166
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,235
But when it matters most...

167
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,839
...he'll just slither back into his hole.

168
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,718
Coward.

169
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,076
Take out your wand.

170
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,835
Will you...

171
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,956
...Severus Snape...

172
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,918
...watch over Draco Malfoy...

173
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,710
...as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?

174
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,631
I will.

175
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,475
And will you,
to the best of your ability...

176
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,236
...protect him from harm?

177
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,868
I will.

178
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,269
And if Draco should fail...

179
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,797
...will you yourself carry out the deed...

180
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,750
...the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?

181
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,233
I will.

182
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,958
Step up! Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancies!

183
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,109
Nosebleed Nougats!

184
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,238
- And just in time for school...
- Puking Pastilles!

185
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,114
- Into the cauldron, handsome.
- Into the cauldron, handsome.

186
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,232
<i>I will have order!</i>

187
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,598
<i>I really hate children. I will have order!</i>

188
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,356
<i>I really hate children. I will have order!</i>

189
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,278
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- A real money spinner, that.

190
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,476
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.

191
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,312
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, ladies.

192
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,631
- Love potions, eh?
- Yeah, they really do work.

193
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,997
Then again, the way we hear it, sis,
you're doing just fine on your own.

194
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,275
Meaning?

195
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,476
Are you not
currently dating Dean Thomas?

196
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,592
It's none of your business.

197
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,109
How much for this?

198
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,599
- Five Galleons.
- Five Galleons.

199
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,796
- How much for me?
- Five Galleons.

200
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,109
I'm your brother.

201
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,436
- Ten Galleons.
- Ten Galleons.

202
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,872
Come on, let's go.

203
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,593
Hi, Ron.

204
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,554
Hi.

205
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,119
How are Fred and George
doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.

206
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,748
Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.

207
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,077
I reckon he's right.

208
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,313
Oh, no.

209
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,990
Everyone got their wands
from Ollivander's.

210
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,279
Harry?

211
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,031
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy
look like two people...

212
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,838
...who don't want to be followed?

213
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,034
<i>Quibbler.</i>

214
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,239
<i>Quibbler.</i>

215
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,551
He's lovely. They've been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.

216
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,995
- <i>Quibbler?</i>
- Oh, please.

217
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,594
- What's a Wrackspurt?
- They're invisible creatures.

218
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,797
They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.

219
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,799
<i>Quibbler.</i>

220
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,479
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?

221
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,278
And who were all those people?

222
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,432
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony, an initiation.

223
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,431
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going.

224
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,989
It's happened. He's one of them.

225
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,593
One of what?

226
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,630
Harry is under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

227
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,677
You're barking.

228
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,876
What would You-Know-Who
want with Malfoy?

229
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,919
Well, then what's he doing in Borgin
and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?

230
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,877
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.

231
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,749
Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.

232
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,433
Hermione saw it with her own eyes.

233
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,797
I told you, I don't know what I saw.

234
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,919
I need some air.

235
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,589
Don't worry. When we get
to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.

236
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,277
- What was that? Blaise?
- Don't know.

237
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,432
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a first-year messing around.

238
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,831
Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

239
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,749
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.

240
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,831
I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower...

241
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,036
...if I had to continue
for another two years.

242
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,474
What's that supposed to mean?

243
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,355
Let's just say you won't see me wasting
my time in Charms class next year.

244
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,832
Amused, Blaise?

245
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,549
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.

246
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,395
You two go on.
I wanna check something.

247
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,708
Where's Harry?

248
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,713
He's probably already on the platform.
Come on.

249
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,116
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

250
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,793
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

251
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,959
Oh, yeah...

252
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,511
...she was dead before you could wipe
the drool off your chin.

253
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,837
That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.

254
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,552
<i>Finite.</i>

255
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,668
- Hello, Harry.
- Luna!

256
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,556
- How'd you know where I was?
- Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.

257
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,560
Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.

258
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,757
That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.

259
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,876
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

260
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,998
That's nice.

261
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,232
About time. I've been looking
all over for you two.

262
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,119
Right. Names?

263
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,635
Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.

264
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,836
No exceptions, Potter.

265
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,032
Who are those people?

266
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,395
Aurors. For security.

267
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,959
What's this cane here, then?

268
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,390
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.

269
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,394
And what exactly would you
be wanting with a...?

270
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,478
Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.

271
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,668
It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

272
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,637
Nice face, Potter.

273
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,150
Would you like me to fix it for you?

274
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,949
Personally, I think you look
a bit more devil-may-care this way...

275
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,599
...but it's up to you.

276
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,195
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?

277
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,909
No, but I've done several toes,
and how different are they, really?

278
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,674
Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.

279
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,956
<i>- Episkey.</i>
- Ah!

280
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,877
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.

281
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,279
Brilliant.

282
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,316
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.

283
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,634
Will you stop eating?

284
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,950
Your best friend is missing!

285
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,237
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.

286
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,353
He's covered in blood again.

287
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,589
- Why is it he's always covered in blood?
- Looks like it's his own this time.

288
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,837
Where have you been?

289
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,355
- What happened to your face?
- Later.

290
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,078
What've I missed?

291
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,229
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.

292
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,790
Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?

293
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,958
Very best of evenings to you all.

294
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,109
Thanks.

295
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,711
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff...

296
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,030
...Horace Slughorn.

297
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,557
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...

298
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,838
...has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.

299
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,798
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...

300
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,678
...will be taken by Professor Snape.

301
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,479
Snape?

302
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,838
Now, as you know...

303
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,515
...each and every one of you was searched
upon your arrival here tonight.

304
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,591
And you have the right to know why.

305
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,796
Once there was a young man,
who, like you...

306
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,315
...sat in this very hall...

307
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,117
...walked this castle's corridors,
slept under its roof.

308
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,878
He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.

309
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,519
His name?

310
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,194
Tom Riddle.

311
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,752
Today, of course...

312
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,477
...he's known all over the world
by another name.

313
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,594
Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...

314
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,035
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

315
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,152
Every day, every hour...

316
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,197
...this very minute, perhaps...

317
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,512
...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.

318
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,393
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

319
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,356
Just something to think about.

320
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,073
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

321
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,398
That was cheerful.

322
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,031
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

323
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,590
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.

324
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,633
Potter.

325
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,797
Oh, this can't be good.

326
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,279
Enjoying ourselves, are we?

327
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,232
- I had a free period this morning.
- So I noticed.

328
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,029
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.

329
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,760
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?

330
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,990
It was, but I was told I had to
get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.

331
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,913
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

332
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,471
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T. s students...

333
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,358
...with "Exceeds Expectations."

334
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,432
Brilliant. Um...

335
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,955
- Well, I'll head there straightaway.
- Oh, good, good.

336
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,830
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

337
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,788
I don't wanna take Potions.

338
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,554
This is Quidditch trials coming up.
I need to practice.

339
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,637
Attention to detail
in the preparation...

340
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,995
...is the prerequisite of all planning.

341
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,759
Ah.

342
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,674
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry.
We've brought someone with us, I see.

343
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,429
Ron Weasley, sir.

344
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,315
But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.

345
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,471
- I'm gonna...
- Nonsense, we'll sort you out.

346
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,598
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.

347
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,194
I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.

348
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,998
Get what you want from the cupboard.

349
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,357
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

350
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,308
Any ideas what these might be?

351
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,228
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

352
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,638
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

353
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,394
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

354
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,472
It's terribly tricky to make.

355
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,596
And this is Amortentia...

356
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,069
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

357
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,635
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

358
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,791
For example, I smell...

359
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,399
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

360
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,757
...spearmint toothpaste.

361
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,430
Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

362
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,390
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

363
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:15,954
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

364
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,953
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.

365
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,958
Oh, yes.

366
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,588
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

367
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,959
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

368
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,510
But it is more commonly referred to as...

369
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,754
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

370
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,118
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

371
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,670
One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

372
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,029
At least until the effects wear off.

373
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,515
So this is what I offer each of you today.

374
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,310
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...

375
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,871
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...

376
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,157
...the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

377
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,835
I should point out, however, only once did
a student manage to brew a potion...

378
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,197
...of sufficient quality to claim this prize.

379
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,910
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.

380
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,478
Let the brewing commence.

381
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,592
How did you do that?

382
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,190
You crush it. Don't cut it.

383
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,749
No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

384
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,672
No, really.

385
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,677
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.

386
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,192
So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.

387
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,237
So here we are, then, as promised.

388
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,472
One vial of Felix Felicis.

389
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,596
Congratulations.

390
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,719
Use it well.

391
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,760
Harry, you got my message. Come in.

392
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,679
How are you?

393
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,319
I'm fine, sir.

394
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,674
Enjoying your classes?

395
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,792
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.

396
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,675
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

397
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,429
Do you?

398
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,154
Definitely.

399
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,799
What about your activities
outside the classroom?

400
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,871
- Sir?
- Well, I notice you spend...

401
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,554
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

402
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,914
I can't help wondering...

403
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,870
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant,
and we're friends, but, no.

404
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,918
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.

405
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,757
But enough chitchat.

406
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,396
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

407
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,679
The answer lies here.

408
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,710
What you are looking at are memories.

409
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,555
In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...

410
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,075
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.

411
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,675
This vial contains
the most particular memory...

412
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,956
...of the day I first met him.

413
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,913
I'd like you to see it, if you would.

414
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,073
<i>I admit some confusion upon</i>
<i>receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.</i>

415
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,710
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.

416
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,475
There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.

417
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,870
Tom, you have a visitor.

418
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,992
How do you do, Tom?

419
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,394
Don't.

420
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,872
- You're the doctor, aren't you?
- No.

421
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,996
I am a professor.

422
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,432
I don't believe you.

423
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,511
She wants me looked at.

424
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,196
They think I'm different.

425
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,793
Well, perhaps they're right.

426
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,359
I'm not mad.

427
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,717
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.

428
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,791
Hogwarts is a school.

429
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,635
A school of magic.

430
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,599
You can do things, can't you, Tom?

431
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,240
Things other children can't.

432
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,393
I can make things move
without touching them.

433
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,716
I can make animals do what I want
without training them.

434
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,870
I can make bad things happen
to people who are mean to me.

435
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,357
I can make them hurt...

436
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,439
...if I want.

437
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,757
Who are you?

438
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,036
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

439
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,559
I'm different.

440
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,913
Prove it.

441
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,875
I think there's something in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.

442
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,829
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts,
Tom.

443
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,438
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.

444
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,715
You understand me?

445
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,954
I can speak to snakes too.

446
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,878
They find me.

447
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,671
Whisper things.

448
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,912
Is that normal for someone like me?

449
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,271
Did you know, sir? Then?

450
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,833
Did I know I'd just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.

451
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,436
If I had, I...

452
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,355
Over time, while here at Hogwarts...

453
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,717
...Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.

454
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,632
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?

455
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,750
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach Potions, did you?

456
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,876
No, I did not.

457
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,715
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.

458
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,477
And he will not give it up easily.

459
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,712
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect me.

460
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,074
I did.

461
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,671
Do you want me to let him?

462
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,319
Yes.

463
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,678
All right. Um...

464
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,798
This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills...

465
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,996
...just to assess your strengths.

466
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,591
Quiet! Please!

467
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,875
Shut it!

468
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,199
Thanks. All right. Um...

469
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,396
Just because you
made the team last year...

470
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,393
...does not guarantee you a spot this year.
Is that clear?

471
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,028
Good.

472
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,516
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?

473
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,189
Hard feelings?

474
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,750
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well.
It's nothing personal.

475
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,480
Really? Strapping guy like you?

476
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,108
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?

477
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,589
Keepers need to be quick, agile.

478
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,638
Oh, I like my chances.

479
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,429
Say, think you could introduce me
to your friend Granger?

480
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,593
Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?

481
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,038
Come on, Weasley!

482
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,838
- Come on, Ron!
- Go on, Weasley!

483
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,073
- Go on, Weasley!
- Yeah, Ron!

484
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,434
Go on, Cormac!

485
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,271
Come on, Ron!

486
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,798
Come on, Ron.

487
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,317
Come on, Ron.

488
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,595
<i>Confundus.</i>

489
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,270
Isn't he brilliant?

490
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,276
I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.

491
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,273
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.

492
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,592
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.

493
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,551
He's vile.

494
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,470
Have you ever heard of this spell?
Sectumsempra?

495
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,631
No, I haven't.

496
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,792
And if you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.

497
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,315
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.

498
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,473
He's even better than you, Hermione.
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.

499
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,788
What?

500
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,194
I'd like to know whose that book was.
Let's have a look.

501
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,793
No.

502
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,468
Why not?

503
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,558
The binding is fragile.

504
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,234
- The binding is fragile?
- Yeah.

505
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,833
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?

506
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,595
That's what it says right here: "This book
is property of the Half-Blood Prince."

507
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,437
<i>For weeks you carry around</i>
<i>this book, practically sleep with it...</i>

508
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,795
<i>... yet you have no desire to find out</i>
<i>who he is?</i>

509
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,236
I didn't say I wasn't curious,
and I don't sleep with it.

510
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,389
Well, it's true.

511
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,155
I like a nice chat before I go to bed.
Now all you do is read that bloody book.

512
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,231
It's just like being with Hermione.

513
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,869
Well, I was curious, so I went to...

514
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,474
- The library.
- The library. And?

515
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,918
And nothing.

516
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,992
I couldn't find a reference anywhere
to a Half-Blood Prince.

517
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,151
- There we go. That settles it, then.
- Filius!

518
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,550
I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!

519
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,191
No, emergency choir practice,
I'm afraid, Horace.

520
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,869
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?

521
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,350
A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.

522
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,990
We had a very long, homemade,
Norwegian-style sledge...

523
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,515
No, not there. Over here.

524
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,599
No, sit beside me.

525
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,508
Okay.

526
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,239
Something to drink?

527
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,834
Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.

528
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,997
Oh, bloody hell.

529
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,592
Slick git.

530
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,480
Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.

531
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,394
And snogging.

532
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,873
- I'd like to leave.
- What?

533
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,553
You can't be serious.

534
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,995
- That happens to be my sister.
- So?

535
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,914
What if she looked over here and saw you
snogging me? You expect her to leave?

536
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,515
- Hey, my boy!
- Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

537
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,591
And you, and you.

538
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,478
So, what brings you here?

539
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,156
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.

540
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,630
I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.

541
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,997
All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy, in the old days...

542
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,436
...I used to throw together
the occasional supper party...

543
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,716
...for the select student or two.

544
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,589
- Would you be game?
- I'd consider it an honor, sir.

545
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,076
You would be welcome too, Granger.

546
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,391
- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid. Look for my owl.

547
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,117
Good to see you, Wallenby.

548
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,478
What are you playing at?

549
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,430
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.

550
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,477
- Get to know him?
- I don't know.

551
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,235
It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

552
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,636
Got a little bit...

553
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,877
Katie, you don't know what it could be.

554
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,439
- Harry.
- What?

555
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,956
Did you hear what she said back
at the pub about me and her snogging?

556
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,392
As if.

557
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,757
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.

558
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,999
Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.

559
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,630
Do not touch that, except by
the wrappings. Do you understand?

560
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,028
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession...

561
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,589
...when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?

562
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,679
It's like I said.

563
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,590
She left to go to the loo, and when
she came back she had the package.

564
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,394
She said it was important
that she deliver it.

565
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,556
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.

566
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,440
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.

567
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,239
Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?

568
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,512
Believe me, professor, I've been asking
myself the same question for six years.

569
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,553
McGONAGALL:
Oh, Severus.

570
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,837
What do you think?

571
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:43,276
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

572
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,590
She was cursed, wasn't she?

573
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,320
I know Katie. Off the pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

574
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,236
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it knowingly.

575
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,231
Yes, she was cursed.

576
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,592
It was Malfoy.

577
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,069
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

578
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,673
Indeed.

579
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,756
- Your evidence?
- I just know.

580
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,391
You just...

581
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,913
...know.

582
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,671
You astonish with your gifts, Potter.

583
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,628
Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.

584
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:27,670
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.

585
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,516
I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.

586
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,398
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?

587
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,951
Well, what does she see in him?

588
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,236
Dean? He's brilliant.

589
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,119
You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.

590
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,909
Yeah, well, he was running his hands
all over my sister, wasn't he?

591
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,437
Something snaps, and you've gotta
hate him, you know? On principle.

592
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,513
I suppose.

593
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,757
- So, what is it he sees in her?
- I don't know.

594
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,789
She's smart, funny.

595
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,715
- Attractive.
- Attractive?

596
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,556
- You know, she's got nice skin.
- Skin?

597
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,112
Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?

598
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,592
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying
it could be a contributing factor.

599
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,512
Hermione's got nice skin.

600
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,839
Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.

601
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,751
I've never really thought about it.

602
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,878
But, I suppose, yeah.

603
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,999
Very nice.

604
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,471
- I think I'll be going to sleep now.
- Right. Yeah.

605
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,708
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

606
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,269
Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him...

607
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,556
...and the Minister for Magic
over the holidays.

608
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,553
Well, be sure to give them both my best.

609
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,631
What about your uncle, Belby?

610
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,110
For those who don't know, Marcus'
uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

611
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,953
- Is he working on anything new?
- Don't know.

612
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:27,033
Him and Dad don't get on. Probably
because me dad says potions are rubbish.

613
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,351
Says the only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.

614
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:35,435
What about you, Miss Granger? What does
your family do in the Muggle world?

615
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,912
My parents are dentists.

616
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,508
They tend to people's teeth.

617
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,231
Fascinating. And is that considered
a dangerous profession?

618
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,628
No.

619
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,832
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick,
did bite my father once.

620
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,194
He needed 10 stitches.

621
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,670
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.

622
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,512
Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.

623
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,274
Sorry. I'm not usually late.

624
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,152
No matter. You're just in time for dessert,
that is, if Belby's left you any.

625
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,795
What?

626
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,518
Nothing.

627
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,070
Goodbye. Bye-bye.

628
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,432
- Potter.
- I'm sorry, sir.

629
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,068
I was just admiring your hourglass.

630
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,799
Oh, yes.

631
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,276
A most intriguing object.

632
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,993
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.

633
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,397
If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.

634
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,711
- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going.

635
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,077
Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.

636
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,390
As to some of your classmates...

637
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,836
...well, let's just say they're unlikely
to make the shelf.

638
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,433
The shelf, sir?

639
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,470
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.

640
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,349
But then again, you already are someone,
aren't you, Harry?

641
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,717
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?

642
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,554
You knew him, didn't you, sir,
Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

643
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,956
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.

644
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,633
What was he like?

645
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,475
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

646
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,872
He killed my parents.

647
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,748
Of course.

648
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,998
It's only natural
you should want to know more.

649
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,719
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry.

650
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,750
When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet...

651
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,993
...albeit brilliant, boy committed
to becoming a first-rate wizard.

652
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,832
Not unlike others I've known.

653
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,391
Not unlike yourself, in fact.

654
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,671
If the monster existed...

655
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,350
...it was buried deep within.

656
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,393
Good luck, eh, Ron.

657
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,115
- Nice hat!
- Ron, you're a loser.

658
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:45,238
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?

659
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,630
- Looking good, Ron.
- Loser!

660
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,193
What's he wearing?

661
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,232
So how was it, then?

662
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,630
- How was what?
- Your dinner party?

663
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,358
Pretty boring, actually.

664
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,350
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

665
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,279
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.

666
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,919
And we're meant to bring someone.

667
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,629
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?

668
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,519
- Actually, I was going to ask you.
- Really?

669
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,151
Good luck today, Ron.

670
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,190
I know you'll be brilliant.

671
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,715
I'm resigning. After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.

672
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,313
Have it your way.

673
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,869
- Juice?
- Sure.

674
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,678
Hello, everyone.

675
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,871
You look dreadful, Ron.

676
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,315
Is that why you put something
in his cup?

677
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,998
Is it a tonic?

678
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,878
Liquid luck.

679
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,792
Don't drink it, Ron.

680
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,311
- You could be expelled for that.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

681
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,954
Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.

682
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,631
Yes!

683
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,759
Go on, Ron! Do it!

684
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,515
<i>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</i>

685
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,279
Yes!

686
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,750
<i>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</i>

687
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,913
Whoo!

688
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,152
Yes. Whoo!

689
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:38,475
<i>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</i>

690
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,198
You really shouldn't have done it.

691
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:49,150
I know. I suppose I could've
just used a Confundus Charm.

692
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:54,557
That was different. That was tryouts.
This was an actual game.

693
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,878
You didn't put it in.

694
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,272
Ron only thought you did.

695
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,271
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

696
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,792
Well, they're really good.

697
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,991
How does it feel, Harry?

698
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,792
When you see Dean with Ginny?

699
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,079
I know.

700
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,190
I see the way you look at her.

701
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,438
You're my best friend.

702
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,912
Oops.

703
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,430
I think this room's taken.

704
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,473
What's with the birds?

705
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,358
<i>Oppugno.</i>

706
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,878
It feels like this.

707
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,872
Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.

708
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:57,909
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.

709
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,433
It's chemical.

710
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,752
Will it last? Who knows?
Point is, I'm a free agent.

711
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,639
He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whoever he likes.

712
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,109
I really couldn't care less.

713
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,955
Was I under the impression he and I would
be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?

714
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,553
Yes.

715
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,952
Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.

716
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,269
Have you?

717
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,351
Yes. Why?

718
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,990
I just thought, seeing as neither of us
can go with who we'd really like to...

719
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,310
...we should go together, as friends.

720
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,038
Why didn't I think of that?

721
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,679
Who are you going with?

722
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,558
Um, it's a surprise.

723
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,759
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry
about. You can't just take anyone.

724
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,157
See that girl over there?

725
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:46,236
That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's
trying to smuggle you a love potion.

726
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,833
Really?

727
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,070
Hey! She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.

728
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,878
But I am the Chosen One.

729
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,793
Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.

730
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,119
I'll ask someone I like.

731
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,359
Someone cool.

732
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,632
I've never been to this part of the castle.

733
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,917
At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.

734
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,469
That's why I wear shoes to bed.

735
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,278
<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</i>

736
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,919
<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</i>

737
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,960
<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</i>

738
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,353
Drink?

739
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,514
Neville.

740
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,079
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

741
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:34,232
It's okay, though. He's got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.

742
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,073
- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
- Okay.

743
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,913
Hermione. What are you doing?
And what happened to you?

744
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:55,154
I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

745
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,232
Cormac? That's who you invited?

746
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,789
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

747
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,511
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

748
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,558
He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.

749
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,790
- Dragon tartare?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

750
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,520
Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.

751
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,432
On second thoughts...

752
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,511
Might keep Cormac at bay.

753
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,638
Oh, God, here he comes.

754
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,833
I think she just went to powder her nose.

755
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,991
Slippery little minx, your friend.

756
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,754
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn't she?

757
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,591
What is this I'm eating, by the way?

758
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,278
Dragon balls.

759
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:50,032
You've just bought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.

760
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,909
Not so quick, Potter.

761
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,392
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date...

762
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:02,314
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.

763
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,630
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.

764
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,390
- A message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.

765
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:11,075
He asked me to give you his best,
and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.

766
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,719
You see...

767
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,193
...he's traveling, and he won't
return until term resumes.

768
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,839
Traveling where?

769
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,437
Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

770
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,158
Professor Slughorn, sir.

771
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:36,472
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.

772
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,596
He claims to have been
invited to your party.

773
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,911
Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?


774
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:44,115
I'll escort him out.

775
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,315
Certainly, professor.

776
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,917
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.

777
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:03,630
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?

778
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,791
I swore to protect you.

779
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,157
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

780
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,390
I don't need protection.

781
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:15,553
I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.

782
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:19,830
- And I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.

783
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,154
You attempt to conceal it,
but it's obvious. Let me assist you.

784
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,719
No!

785
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,316
I was chosen. This is my moment.

786
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,753
"Unbreakable Vow."

787
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,478
You're sure that's what Snape said?

788
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,835
Positive. Why?

789
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,356
Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

790
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,717
I'd worked that much out for myself,
funnily enough.

791
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,872
You don't understand.

792
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,469
Oh, bloody hell.

793
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,037
I miss you.

794
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,159
Lovely.

795
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:32,471
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped. Look.

796
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,756
I'll take your word for it.

797
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:49,195
So, what happens to you? What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

798
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,358
You die.

799
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,557
Wait, the pudding's still here.

800
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,957
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?

801
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,155
I know it sounds mad.

802
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,676
Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

803
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,229
...so he could find out
what he was up to?

804
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,278
- That's not what it sounded like.
- Perhaps Harry's right.

805
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,358
To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...

806
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,876
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

807
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,953
- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
- Dumbledore can make mistakes.

808
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,235
You're blinded by hatred.

809
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,356
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

810
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,918
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.

811
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,957
We place our trust
in a handful of people.

812
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,953
If we start fighting amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.

813
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,919
Open up, you.

814
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,078
Don't you trust me?

815
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,115
It's good.

816
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,719
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.

817
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,873
- Pie?
- Not for me, no.

818
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,799
You'll have to forgive Remus.

819
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:38,759
It takes its toll, his condition.

820
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,596
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?

821
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,194
We're being followed, all of us.

822
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,749
Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.

823
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,551
It's not been easy.

824
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,833
Did you get my owl?

825
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,991
Yes, I did.

826
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,352
If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

827
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,875
...but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

828
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,949
As for Draco Malfoy...

829
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,675
...I know a bit more.

830
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,192
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

831
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,590
I think, from what you described...

832
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,352
...what you and Ron saw in summer...

833
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,876
...the object
that Draco is so interested in...

834
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,473
...is a vanishing cabinet.

835
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,548
A vanishing cabinet?

836
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:25,554
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.

837
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,553
You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking...

838
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:33,271
...one simply had to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.

839
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,552
They can transport you anywhere.

840
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,951
Tricky contraptions though,
very temperamental.

841
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,918
What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?

842
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,149
Nothing.

843
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,598
It's still there.

844
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,878
It was delicious, Molly, really.

845
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,314
Are you sure you won't stay?

846
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:03,678
No, we should go. The first night
of the cycle's always the worst.

847
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:04,829
Remus?

848
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,879
Sweetheart.

849
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,512
Has Ron gone to bed?

850
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,399
Um... Not yet. No.

851
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,394
Shoelace.

852
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,277
Merry Christmas, Harry.

853
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,119
Merry Christmas.

854
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,875
- Harry, no!
- Remus!

855
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,673
Ginny!

856
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:24,191
<i>I killed Sirius Black!</i>
<i>I killed Sirius Black!</i>

857
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,510
You coming to get me?

858
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,757
Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?

859
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,599
Harry?

860
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,992
<i>Stupefy!</i>

861
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,592
Harry!

862
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,709
Ginny!

863
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,513
Molly.

864
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,198
It's easy for them to get to you.

865
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:54,319
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

866
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,914
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?

867
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:58,989
Sorry.

868
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,797
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.

869
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,030
That's my Won-Won.

870
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,269
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

871
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,395
<i>I'd like to know</i>
<i>where you get your information.</i>

872
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,472
<i>More knowledgeable</i>
<i>than half the staff, you are.</i>

873
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,359
Sir...

874
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,519
...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

875
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,353
Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?

876
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,593
By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.

877
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,355
But how did you know?

878
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,633
Intuition.

879
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,278
Gracious. Is it that time already?

880
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,955
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.

881
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:12,595
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.

882
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,431
- Is something on your mind, Tom?
- Yes, sir.

883
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,439
You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.

884
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:26,110
The other professors,
well, they're not like you.

885
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,392
They might misunderstand.

886
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,073
Go on.

887
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,035
I was in the library the other night...

888
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,676
...in the Restricted Section...

889
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,790
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

890
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:45,036
And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.

891
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,873
It's called, as I understand it...

892
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,795
I beg your pardon?

893
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,396
I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

894
01:19:55,560 --> 01:20:00,156
Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

895
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,115
Confused?

896
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,193
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

897
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,719
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?

898
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:13,395
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.

899
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,392
It is also a lie.

900
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,998
This memory has been tampered with...

901
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:22,358
...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

902
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,871
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?

903
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,793
- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?

904
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,393
Why, indeed?

905
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:33,391
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

906
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:37,030
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...

907
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,679
...any way you can.

908
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,717
I don't know him that well, sir.

909
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,798
This memory is everything.

910
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,191
Without it, we are blind.

911
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:54,150
Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.

912
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,872
You have no choice.

913
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,951
You must not fail.

914
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,950
So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...

915
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,519
...with the chapter on antidotes.

916
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:16,275
I'll tell you more about bezoars
in our next class. Right, off you go.

917
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,829
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

918
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:27,709
Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.

919
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,711
To what do I owe this pleasure?

920
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,831
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.

921
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,150
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

922
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:38,198
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...

923
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,875
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

924
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,720
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?

925
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:49,077
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.

926
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:53,392
It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

927
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,594
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

928
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,479
I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.

929
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,471
Yes. Um...

930
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,029
He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.

931
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,918
What I mean to say is...

932
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,438
...well, he's not like you.

933
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:10,832
He might misunderstand.

934
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:15,755
Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.

935
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,799
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.

936
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,992
I suggest you do the same.

937
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:25,238
Is that what you told Tom Riddle,
when he came asking questions?

938
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,832
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?

939
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,318
Didn't he?

940
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,628
Yes?

941
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,036
Oh, it's you, Potter.

942
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,475
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

943
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,389
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.

944
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:09,713
Divine.

945
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,555
Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?

946
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:17,076
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

947
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:20,596
- Or 20.
- I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

948
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,671
Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.

949
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:25,070
She could never annoy me.

950
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,279
I think I love her.

951
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,915
Well, brilliant.

952
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,158
Do you think she knows I exist?

953
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,709
I hope so. She's been snogging you
for three months.

954
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:44,713
Snogging? Who are you talking about?

955
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,794
Who are you talking about?

956
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,990
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

957
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,593
Okay, very funny.

958
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,115
- What was that for?
- It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

959
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,033
Fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?

960
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,793
No. Can you introduce me?

961
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:31,151
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you
to Romilda Vane.

962
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:45,029
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

963
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,193
Where's Romilda?

964
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,237
What's the matter with Wenby?

965
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,472
Very powerful love potion.

966
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:53,915
Very well. Better bring him in.

967
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:57,231
I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

968
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,198
Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.

969
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,318
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

970
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:05,072
Perhaps you're right.

971
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:14,599
I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

972
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:18,958
Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?

973
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,918
I expect you're tired of it
after all these years.

974
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,548
All the questions about Voldemort.

975
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,472
Don't use that name.

976
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,871
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

977
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:39,032
- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.

978
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,155
- What happened to me?
- Love potion.

979
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,356
A bloody strong one at that.

980
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,390
- I feel really bad.
- You need a pick-me-up.

981
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:05,075
Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

982
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:09,392
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...

983
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,238
Here we are, Potter.

984
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,833
To life!

985
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,429
Ron.

986
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,110
Ron. Professor, do something.

987
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,718
I don't understand.

988
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,158
Come on, Ron, breathe.

989
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,199
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

990
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:23,991
Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.

991
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,435
You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.

992
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:29,876
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.

993
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,679
I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.

994
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:36,674
The question is,
why were they necessary?

995
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,512
Why, indeed?

996
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,591
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

997
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,639
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?

998
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,588
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

999
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,115
...when not polluted with poison.

1000
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:53,272
Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.

1001
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,759
To whom, I might ask?

1002
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,590
To you, Headmaster.

1003
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:01,875
Where is he?

1004
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:05,999
Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?

1005
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,512
What's she doing here?

1006
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,830
I might ask you the same question.

1007
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,150
I happen to be his girlfriend.

1008
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,959
I happen to be his friend.

1009
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:22,159
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.

1010
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,673
I suppose you want to make up
now that he's all interesting.

1011
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:29,389
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

1012
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:32,279
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

1013
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:38,715
Ah. See? He senses my presence.

1014
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,031
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

1015
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,432
I'm here.

1016
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:53,112
Uh... Hermione...

1017
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,911
Hermione.

1018
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:01,790
Hermione.

1019
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:12,834
Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.

1020
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,390
Well, come away, everybody.

1021
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:18,074
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

1022
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:24,594
About time, don't you think?

1023
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,673
Thank you.

1024
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,232
Oh, shut up.

1025
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:43,749
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

1026
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,600
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

1027
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:54,119
Um, well...

1028
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:57,158
...she came to visit you
in the hospital.

1029
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,309
And you talked.

1030
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:05,753
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

1031
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,071
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.

1032
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,470
It's just she seems a bit put out.

1033
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:21,076
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

1034
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:27,475
You say you don't remember
anything from that night?

1035
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:30,518
Anything at all?

1036
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,432
There is something.

1037
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:40,078
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?

1038
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,592
Right. Boggled.

1039
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:52,754
Harry.

1040
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,275
That's Katie.

1041
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,718
Katie Bell.

1042
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,355
Katie. How are you?

1043
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,312
I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.

1044
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,270
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

1045
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:21,956
But I just can't.

1046
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,954
Katie?

1047
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:20,593
I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?

1048
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,631
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

1049
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:39,478
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

1050
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:43,799
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

1051
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,753
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

1052
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,390
You have to get rid of it. Today.

1053
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,638
Take my hand.

1054
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,791
The Room of Requirement.

1055
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,514
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...

1056
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:48,229
...where no one will ever find it,
including you.

1057
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:57,639
- What was that?
- What was that?

1058
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,954
See?

1059
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,436
You never know what you'll find up here.

1060
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,554
All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

1061
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,878
Close your eyes.

1062
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:22,233
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.

1063
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:38,555
So did you and Ginny do it, then?

1064
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,835
What?

1065
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,991
You know, hide the book?

1066
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,957
Oh, yeah.

1067
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:49,228
Ah. Dear, yes.

1068
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:52,073
Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?

1069
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,314
Luck.

1070
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:59,517
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

1071
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,992
Well, how do you feel?

1072
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,718
Excellent.

1073
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:24,751
Really excellent.

1074
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:28,913
Remember...

1075
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:30,912
...Slughorn usually eats early...

1076
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,958
...takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.

1077
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:35,553
Right.

1078
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:38,030
- I'm going down to Hagrid's.
- What?

1079
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:40,760
No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.

1080
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:44,748
- We have a plan.
- I know...

1081
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,911
...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.

1082
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:50,675
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?

1083
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,670
- No.
- Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

1084
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,910
Or Felix does.

1085
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,433
Hi!

1086
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,438
Merlin's beard, Harry!

1087
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,559
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.

1088
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,597
You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.

1089
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:39,036
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?

1090
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,191
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

1091
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:44,033
The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.

1092
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,636
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir?
They're very valuable, aren't they?

1093
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:50,030
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

1094
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:53,556
Not that I'm familiar with any such
transactions, but one does hear rumors.

1095
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:57,349
My own interests
are purely academic, of course.

1096
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,671
Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.

1097
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:05,870
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?

1098
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,473
Through the front door, sir.

1099
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,710
I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...

1100
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:11,518
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

1101
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:13,875
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.

1102
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,198
Harry!

1103
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,355
- Sir?
- It's nearly nightfall.

1104
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:22,830
Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

1105
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,468
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

1106
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:33,672
Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...

1107
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,512
...back to the castle immediately!

1108
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,797
That would be counterproductive, sir.

1109
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,116
And what makes you say that?

1110
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:44,673
No idea.

1111
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,513
Horace.

1112
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:58,194
Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?

1113
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:00,751
A dead one, I think, sir.

1114
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:02,999
Good God.

1115
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:06,558
Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?

1116
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:10,150
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.

1117
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:14,359
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

1118
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:18,150
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

1119
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,436
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.

1120
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:22,717
Not to mention the pincers.

1121
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,717
Yeah, I reckon that too.

1122
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:32,631
Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...

1123
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:36,713
...but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.

1124
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,996
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?

1125
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,674
Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.

1126
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,638
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?

1127
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,949
My thoughts exactly.

1128
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:52,355
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

1129
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:57,390
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

1130
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:00,395
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

1131
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:04,075
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

1132
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,953
Oh, dear.

1133
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:19,352
- Would you like me to say a few words?
- Yes.

1134
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,079
He had a family, I trust?

1135
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:22,673
Oh, yeah.

1136
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,233
Farewell...

1137
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,197
Aragog.

1138
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:38,318
Farewell, Aragog...

1139
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:41,240
...king of the arachnids.

1140
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:44,508
Your body will decay...

1141
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:48,439
...but your spirit lingers on.

1142
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:55,468
And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.

1143
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:13,510
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1144
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:17,229
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

1145
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:22,349
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1146
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:27,469
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

1147
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:29,153
Poof.

1148
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:32,392
- That's very odd, isn't it?
- It is, isn't it?

1149
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:36,109
But that's life, I suppose.

1150
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:41,400
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

1151
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:45,075
- Poof.
- Poof.

1152
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:02,032
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1153
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,118
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1154
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,833
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1155
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:14,990
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1156
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,835
As I watched, it sank.

1157
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:22,999
Just before it reached the bottom...

1158
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:24,559
...it transformed...

1159
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:27,632
...into a wee fish.

1160
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,276
It was beautiful magic.

1161
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:34,390
Wondrous to behold.

1162
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:39,559
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1163
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:42,829
Your mother.

1164
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:47,189
The day I came downstairs...

1165
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:50,315
...the day the bowl was empty...

1166
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,870
...was the day your mother...

1167
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:59,631
I know why you're here.

1168
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:04,431
But I can't help you.

1169
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:07,798
It would ruin me.

1170
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:13,715
Do you know why I survived, professor?

1171
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:15,992
The night I got this?

1172
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:19,238
Because of her.

1173
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,838
Because she sacrificed herself.

1174
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:24,515
Because she refused to step aside.

1175
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:27,752
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

1176
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:31,469
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

1177
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:34,316
I'm going to tell you something.

1178
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:38,033
Something others have only guessed at.

1179
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,353
It's true.

1180
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:43,148
I am the Chosen One.

1181
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:46,236
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

1182
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,551
...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

1183
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:51,995
...and I need to know what you told him.

1184
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:54,989
Be brave, professor.

1185
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,551
Be brave like my mother.

1186
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:02,360
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

1187
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:05,635
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

1188
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:11,594
Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

1189
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:24,712
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1190
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:29,791
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

1191
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,634
I was in the library the other night...

1192
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,870
...in the Restricted Section...

1193
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:14,190
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1194
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:18,079
It's called, as I understand it...

1195
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:20,594
...a Horcrux.

1196
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:24,999
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1197
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:27,960
I came across the term while reading...

1198
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:30,998
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1199
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:32,832
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

1200
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,468
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

1201
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:37,119
Which is...

1202
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:39,952
...why I came to you.

1203
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:48,073
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1204
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:50,754
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1205
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:57,074
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1206
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:00,710
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1207
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:01,949
Protected?

1208
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:05,192
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1209
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:08,909
In other words, you cannot die.

1210
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:18,837
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1211
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,673
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1212
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:24,273
Murder.

1213
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:26,034
Yes.

1214
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:31,270
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1215
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:36,671
Can you only split the soul
once? For instance, isn't seven...?

1216
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:38,273
Seven?

1217
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:44,074
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1218
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:47,835
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1219
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:51,872
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

1220
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:57,714
Of course, sir.

1221
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,471
It'll be our little secret.

1222
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:12,114
Sir.

1223
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,916
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1224
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:31,640
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1225
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:34,792
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1226
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:35,949
What are they exactly?

1227
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:39,317
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1228
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:43,998
A ring, for example.

1229
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:46,033
Or a book.

1230
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,555
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

1231
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,076
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1232
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:54,435
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1233
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:56,431
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1234
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:01,390
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1235
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:03,471
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1236
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:08,391
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1237
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:12,269
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1238
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:13,555
One destroys Voldemort.

1239
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:16,518
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1240
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:19,797
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1241
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:34,997
...leaves traces.

1242
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:44,471
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1243
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,835
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

1244
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:50,598
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1245
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:54,673
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1246
01:51:56,160 --> 01:52:00,631
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1247
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:06,635
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1248
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:09,314
...that you take too much for granted?

1249
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:14,315
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

1250
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:16,516
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1251
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:22,912
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1252
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:42,118
Oh, Harry.

1253
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,830
You need a shave, my friend.

1254
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:53,559
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1255
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:57,508
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1256
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,275
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1257
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:03,153
I'm an old man.

1258
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:04,912
You still look the same to me, sir.

1259
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:09,198
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1260
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:12,432
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1261
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:19,392
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1262
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:22,916
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1263
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:24,832
But there is one condition:

1264
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,072
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1265
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:30,478
Yes, sir.

1266
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:32,676
You do understand what I'm saying?

1267
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:35,629
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1268
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:38,030
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1269
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:42,034
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1270
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,513
Your word, Harry.

1271
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,513
My word.

1272
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:53,872
Take my arm.

1273
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:57,549
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1274
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:01,510
Well, being me has its privileges.

1275
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:48,398
This is the place.

1276
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:50,673
Oh, yes.

1277
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:54,028
This place has known magic.

1278
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,199
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...

1279
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:04,713
...payment must be made.

1280
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:08,350
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1281
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:11,632
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

1282
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:14,674
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1283
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:40,117
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1284
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:43,477
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1285
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:47,313
Careful.

1286
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:10,949
There it is.

1287
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,994
The only question is,
how do we get there?

1288
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:38,032
If you would, Harry.

1289
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:25,709
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1290
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:27,639
Oh, yes.

1291
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:39,793
It has to be drunk.

1292
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,679
All of it has to be drunk.

1293
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:46,677
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?

1294
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:49,149
This potion might paralyze me.

1295
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:51,152
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1296
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:55,071
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

1297
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:57,151
You are not to indulge these requests.

1298
01:57:57,320 --> 01:58:00,710
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1299
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:03,235
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

1300
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:05,716
- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?

1301
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:11,079
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.

1302
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:16,831
Your good health, Harry.

1303
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:33,548
Professor.

1304
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:36,749
Professor!

1305
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:44,593
Harry.

1306
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:47,149
Professor, can you hear me?

1307
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:49,515
Professor.

1308
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:05,389
No. Don't.

1309
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:07,790
You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?

1310
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:18,477
- Stop.
- It will stop. It will stop...

1311
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:22,872
...but only if you keep drinking.
- Please, don't make me.

1312
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:25,076
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Please.

1313
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:27,435
- Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

1314
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,315
It's my fault.

1315
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:33,069
It's all my fault.

1316
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:36,398
It's my fault.

1317
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:39,791
Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise...

1318
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:42,670
...I promise I'll do what you say.

1319
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:44,592
- I promise.
- No.

1320
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:46,919
Please.

1321
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,479
Harry.

1322
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:19,309
Water.

1323
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:21,349
Water.

1324
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:23,238
Water.

1325
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:31,198
You did it, sir.

1326
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:32,759
Look.

1327
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:35,874
Harry.

1328
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:38,474
Water.

1329
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:41,752
<i>Aguamenti.</i>

1330
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:43,359
Water.

1331
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,359
<i>Lumos.</i>

1332
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:48,471
<i>Lumos Maxima!</i>

1333
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:59,312
Harry.

1334
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:04,269
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

1335
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:05,555
Harry.

1336
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:08,038
<i>- Stupefy!</i>
- Harry.

1337
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:06,028
Harry.

1338
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:12,110
<i>Partis Temporus!</i>

1339
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:55,912
Go to your houses. No dawdling.

1340
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:38,629
We need to get you to the hospital
wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.

1341
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:42,279
No.

1342
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:45,840
Severus. Severus is who I need.

1343
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,390
Wake him. Tell him what happened.

1344
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:51,152
Speak to no one else.

1345
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:53,876
Severus, Harry.

1346
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:01,269
Hide yourself below, Harry.

1347
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:05,558
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.

1348
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:09,349
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.

1349
02:05:10,120 --> 02:05:11,712
Harry, do as I say.

1350
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:16,428
Trust me.

1351
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:19,519
Trust me.

1352
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:40,992
Good evening, Draco.

1353
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:45,230
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?

1354
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:47,072
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

1355
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:51,153
I often talk aloud to
myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.

1356
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:55,919
Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?

1357
02:05:58,320 --> 02:05:59,719
Draco...

1358
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:03,193
...you are no assassin.
- How do you know what I am?

1359
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:05,078
I've done things that would shock you.

1360
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:09,199
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in
return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?

1361
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:11,874
Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?

1362
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:13,553
Forgive me, Draco.

1363
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:16,109
I cannot help feeling these actions
are so weak...

1364
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:18,555
...your heart can't really
have been in them.

1365
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:21,792
He trusts me. I was chosen.

1366
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,158
Then I shall make it easy for you.

1367
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:28,912
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1368
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:34,350
Very good. Very good.

1369
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:37,439
You're not alone.

1370
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:39,469
There are others.

1371
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:42,793
How?

1372
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:46,600
The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.

1373
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:49,595
- I've been mending it.
- Let me guess.

1374
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:52,593
It has a sister. A twin.

1375
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:54,876
In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.

1376
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:56,758
Ingenious.

1377
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:58,594
Draco...

1378
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:04,596
...years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

1379
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:08,278
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help!

1380
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:12,396
Don't you understand? I have to do this.

1381
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:15,152
I have to kill you.

1382
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:17,716
Or he's gonna kill me.

1383
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:30,310
Well, look what we have here.

1384
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:34,190
Well done, Draco.

1385
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:39,472
Good evening, Bellatrix.

1386
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:42,550
I think introductions
are in order, don't you?

1387
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:47,635
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid
we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.

1388
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:49,559
Do it.

1389
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:54,759
He doesn't have the stomach,
just like his father.

1390
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:56,593
Let me finish him in my own way.

1391
02:07:56,760 --> 02:08:00,230
No! The Dark Lord was clear,
the boy is to do it.

1392
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:02,356
This is your moment. Do it.

1393
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,751
Go on, Draco.

1394
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:07,990
Now!

1395
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:10,474
No.

1396
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:23,359
Severus.

1397
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,399
Please.

1398
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:35,634
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

1399
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:19,957
Yeah!

1400
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:40,710
Hagrid! Hello?

1401
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:44,759
Snape! He trusted you!

1402
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:50,478
Go on.

1403
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:52,758
<i>Incarcerous.</i>

1404
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:55,480
Fight back! You coward, fight back!

1405
02:09:57,040 --> 02:10:00,112
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.

1406
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:20,759
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

1407
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:33,908
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?

1408
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:35,755
Yes.

1409
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:40,433
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

1410
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:20,559
McGONAGALL:
Potter...

1411
02:14:21,240 --> 02:14:23,629
...in light of what has happened...

1412
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:28,151
...if you should have the need
to talk to someone...

1413
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:33,874
You should know,
Professor Dumbledore...

1414
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:37,995
...you meant a great deal to him.

1415
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:57,590
Do you think he would've done it?

1416
02:14:57,760 --> 02:14:59,557
Draco?

1417
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:01,874
No.

1418
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,956
No, he was lowering his wand.

1419
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:07,837
In the end, it was Snape.

1420
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:10,795
It was always Snape.

1421
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:13,076
And I did nothing.

1422
02:15:19,480 --> 02:15:20,833
It's fake.

1423
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:23,634
Open it.

1424
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:38,034
"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead
long before you read this...

1425
02:15:38,200 --> 02:15:41,715
...but I want you to know that it was I
who discovered your secret.

1426
02:15:42,680 --> 02:15:46,389
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend
to destroy it as soon as I can.

1427
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:49,472
I face death in the hope that
when you meet your match...

1428
02:15:49,640 --> 02:15:51,790
...you will be mortal once more.

1429
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:54,632
R.A.B."

1430
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:57,239
R.A.B.

1431
02:15:57,600 --> 02:15:58,828
Don't know.

1432
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:03,320
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.

1433
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:05,719
Which means it was all a waste.

1434
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:08,433
All of it.

1435
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:16,391
Ron's okay with it, you know.

1436
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:18,313
You and Ginny.

1437
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:22,469
But if I were you, when he's around,
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.

1438
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:25,671
I'm not coming back, Hermione.

1439
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:29,394
I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.

1440
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:32,279
And I don't know where that'll lead me...

1441
02:16:32,440 --> 02:16:35,910
...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am when I can.

1442
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:39,714
I've always admired your courage, Harry.

1443
02:16:39,880 --> 02:16:42,440
But sometimes, you can be really thick.

1444
02:16:45,360 --> 02:16:47,510
You don't really think
you're going to be able...

1445
02:16:47,680 --> 02:16:49,955
...to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?

1446
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:55,632
You need us, Harry.

1447
02:17:10,800 --> 02:17:13,758
I never realized
how beautiful this place was.
