1
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,751
<i>I killed Sirius Black!</i>
<i>I killed Sirius Black!</i>

2
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,790
You coming to get me?

3
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,637
Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,599
Harry?

5
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,992
<i>Stupefy!</i>

6
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,592
Harry!

7
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,709
Ginny!

8
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,513
Molly.

9
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,198
It's easy for them to get to you.

10
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,319
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

11
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,914
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?

12
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,989
Sorry.

13
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,797
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.

14
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,030
That's my Won-Won.

15
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,269
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

16
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,395
<i>I'd like to know</i>
<i>where you get your information.</i>

17
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,472
<i>More knowledgeable</i>
<i>than half the staff, you are.</i>

18
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,359
Sir...

19
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,519
...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

20
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,353
Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?

21
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,593
By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.

22
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,355
But how did you know?

23
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,633
Intuition.

24
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,278
Gracious. Is it that time already?

25
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,955
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.

26
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,595
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.

27
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,431
- Is something on your mind, Tom?
- Yes, sir.

28
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,439
You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.

29
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,110
The other professors,
well, they're not like you.

30
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,392
They might misunderstand.

31
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,073
Go on.

32
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,035
I was in the library the other night...

33
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,676
...in the Restricted Section...

34
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,790
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

35
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,036
And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.

36
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,873
It's called, as I understand it...

37
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,795
I beg your pardon?

38
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,396
I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

39
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,156
Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,115
Confused?

41
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,193
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

42
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,719
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?

43
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,395
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.

44
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,392
It is also a lie.

45
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,998
This memory has been tampered with...

46
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,358
...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

47
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,871
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?

48
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,793
- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?

49
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,393
Why, indeed?

50
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,391
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

51
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,030
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...

52
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,679
...any way you can.

53
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,717
I don't know him that well, sir.

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,798
This memory is everything.

55
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,191
Without it, we are blind.

56
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,150
Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.

57
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,872
You have no choice.

58
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,951
You must not fail.

59
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,950
So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...

60
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,519
...with the chapter on antidotes.

61
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,275
I'll tell you more about bezoars
in our next class. Right, off you go.

62
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,829
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

63
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,709
Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.

64
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,711
To what do I owe this pleasure?

65
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,831
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,150
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

67
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,198
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...

68
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,875
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

69
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,720
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?

70
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,077
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.

71
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,392
It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

72
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,594
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

73
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,479
I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.

74
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,471
Yes. Um...

75
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,029
He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.

76
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,918
What I mean to say is...

77
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,438
...well, he's not like you.

78
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,832
He might misunderstand.

79
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,755
Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.

80
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,799
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.

81
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,992
I suggest you do the same.

82
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,238
Is that what you told Tom Riddle,
when he came asking questions?

83
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,832
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?

84
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,318
Didn't he?

85
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,628
Yes?

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,036
Oh, it's you, Potter.

87
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,475
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

88
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,389
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.

89
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,713
Divine.

90
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,555
Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?

91
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,076
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

92
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,596
- Or 20.
- I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

93
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,671
Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.

94
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,070
She could never annoy me.

95
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,279
I think I love her.

96
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,915
Well, brilliant.

97
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,158
Do you think she knows I exist?

98
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,709
I hope so. She's been snogging you
for three months.

99
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,713
Snogging? Who are you talking about?

100
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,794
Who are you talking about?

101
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,990
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

102
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,593
Okay, very funny.

103
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,115
- What was that for?
- It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

104
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,033
Fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?

105
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,793
No. Can you introduce me?

106
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,151
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you
to Romilda Vane.

107
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,029
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

108
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,193
Where's Romilda?

109
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,237
What's the matter with Wenby?

110
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,472
Very powerful love potion.

111
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,915
Very well. Better bring him in.

112
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,231
I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

113
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,198
Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.

114
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,318
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

115
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,072
Perhaps you're right.

116
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,599
I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

117
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,958
Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?

118
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,918
I expect you're tired of it
after all these years.

119
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,548
All the questions about Voldemort.

120
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,472
Don't use that name.

121
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,871
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

122
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,032
- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.

123
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,155
- What happened to me?
- Love potion.

124
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,356
A bloody strong one at that.

125
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,390
- I feel really bad.
- You need a pick-me-up.

126
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,075
Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

127
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,392
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...

128
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,238
Here we are, Potter.

129
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,833
To life!

130
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,429
Ron.

131
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,110
Ron. Professor, do something.

132
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,718
I don't understand.

133
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,158
Come on, Ron, breathe.

134
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,199
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

135
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,991
Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.

136
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,435
You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.

137
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,876
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.

138
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,679
I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.

139
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,674
The question is,
why were they necessary?

140
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,512
Why, indeed?

141
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,591
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

142
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,639
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?

143
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,588
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

144
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,115
...when not polluted with poison.

145
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,272
Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.

146
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,759
To whom, I might ask?

147
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,590
To you, Headmaster.

148
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,875
Where is he?

149
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,999
Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?

150
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,512
What's she doing here?

151
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,830
I might ask you the same question.

152
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,150
I happen to be his girlfriend.

153
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,959
I happen to be his friend.

154
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,159
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.

155
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,673
I suppose you want to make up
now that he's all interesting.

156
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,389
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

157
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,279
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

158
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,715
Ah. See? He senses my presence.

159
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,031
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

160
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,432
I'm here.

161
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,112
Uh... Hermione...

162
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,911
Hermione.

163
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,790
Hermione.

164
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,834
Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.

165
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,390
Well, come away, everybody.

166
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,074
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

167
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,594
About time, don't you think?

168
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,673
Thank you.

169
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,232
Oh, shut up.

170
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,749
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

171
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,600
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

172
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,119
Um, well...

173
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,158
...she came to visit you
in the hospital.

174
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,309
And you talked.

175
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,753
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

176
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,071
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.

177
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,470
It's just she seems a bit put out.

178
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,076
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

179
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,475
You say you don't remember
anything from that night?

180
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,518
Anything at all?

181
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,432
There is something.

182
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,078
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?

183
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,592
Right. Boggled.

184
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,754
Harry.

185
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,275
That's Katie.

186
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,718
Katie Bell.

187
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,355
Katie. How are you?

188
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,312
I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.

189
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,270
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

190
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,956
But I just can't.

191
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,954
Katie?

192
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,593
I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?

193
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,631
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

194
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,478
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

195
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,799
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

196
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,753
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

197
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,390
You have to get rid of it. Today.

198
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,638
Take my hand.

199
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,791
The Room of Requirement.

200
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,514
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...

201
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,229
...where no one will ever find it,
including you.

202
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,639
- What was that?
- What was that?

203
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,954
See?

204
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,436
You never know what you'll find up here.

205
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,554
All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

206
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,878
Close your eyes.

207
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,233
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.

208
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,555
So did you and Ginny do it, then?

209
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,835
What?

210
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,991
You know, hide the book?

211
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,957
Oh, yeah.

212
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,228
Ah. Dear, yes.

213
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,073
Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?

214
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,314
Luck.

215
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,517
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

216
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,992
Well, how do you feel?

217
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,718
Excellent.

218
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,751
Really excellent.

219
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,913
Remember...

220
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,912
...Slughorn usually eats early...

221
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,958
...takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.

222
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,553
Right.

223
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,030
- I'm going down to Hagrid's.
- What?

224
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,760
No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.

225
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,748
- We have a plan.
- I know...

226
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,911
...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.

227
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,675
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?

228
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,670
- No.
- Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

229
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,910
Or Felix does.

230
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,433
Hi!

231
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,438
Merlin's beard, Harry!

232
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,559
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.

233
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,597
You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.

234
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,036
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?

235
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,191
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

236
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,033
The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.

237
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,636
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir?
They're very valuable, aren't they?

238
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,030
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

239
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,556
Not that I'm familiar with any such
transactions, but one does hear rumors.

240
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,349
My own interests
are purely academic, of course.

241
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,671
Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.

242
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,870
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?

243
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,473
Through the front door, sir.

244
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,710
I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...

245
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,518
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

246
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,875
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.

247
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,198
Harry!

248
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,355
- Sir?
- It's nearly nightfall.

249
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,830
Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

250
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,468
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

251
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,672
Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...

252
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,512
...back to the castle immediately!

253
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,797
That would be counterproductive, sir.

254
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,116
And what makes you say that?

255
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,673
No idea.

256
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,513
Horace.

257
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,194
Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?

258
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,751
A dead one, I think, sir.

259
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,999
Good God.

260
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,558
Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?

261
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,150
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.

262
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,359
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

263
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,150
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

264
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,436
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.

265
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,717
Not to mention the pincers.

266
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,717
Yeah, I reckon that too.

267
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,631
Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...

268
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,713
...but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.

269
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,996
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?

270
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,674
Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.

271
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,638
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?

272
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,949
My thoughts exactly.

273
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:30,355
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

274
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,390
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

275
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,395
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

276
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,075
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

277
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,953
Oh, dear.

278
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,352
- Would you like me to say a few words?
- Yes.

279
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,079
He had a family, I trust?

280
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,673
Oh, yeah.

281
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,233
Farewell...

282
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,197
Aragog.

283
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,318
Farewell, Aragog...

284
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,240
...king of the arachnids.

285
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,508
Your body will decay...

286
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,439
...but your spirit lingers on.

287
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,468
And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.

288
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,510
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

289
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,229
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

290
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,349
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

291
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,469
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

292
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,153
Poof.

293
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,392
- That's very odd, isn't it?
- It is, isn't it?

294
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,109
But that's life, I suppose.

295
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,400
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

296
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,075
- Poof.
- Poof.

297
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,032
It was a student who gave me Francis.

298
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,118
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

299
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,833
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

300
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,990
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

301
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,835
As I watched, it sank.

302
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,999
Just before it reached the bottom...

303
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,559
...it transformed...

304
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,632
...into a wee fish.

305
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,276
It was beautiful magic.

306
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,390
Wondrous to behold.

307
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,559
The flower petal had come from a lily.

308
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,829
Your mother.

309
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,189
The day I came downstairs...

310
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,315
...the day the bowl was empty...

311
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,870
...was the day your mother...

312
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,631
I know why you're here.

313
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,431
But I can't help you.

314
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,798
It would ruin me.

315
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,715
Do you know why I survived, professor?

316
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,992
The night I got this?

317
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,238
Because of her.

318
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,838
Because she sacrificed herself.

319
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,515
Because she refused to step aside.

320
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,752
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

321
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,469
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

322
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,316
I'm going to tell you something.

323
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,033
Something others have only guessed at.

324
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,353
It's true.

325
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,148
I am the Chosen One.

326
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,236
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

327
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,551
...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

328
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,995
...and I need to know what you told him.

329
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,989
Be brave, professor.

330
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,551
Be brave like my mother.

331
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,360
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

332
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,635
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

333
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,594
Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

334
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,712
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

335
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,791
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

336
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,634
I was in the library the other night...

337
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,870
...in the Restricted Section...

338
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,190
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

339
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,079
It's called, as I understand it...

340
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,594
...a Horcrux.

341
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,999
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

342
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,960
I came across the term while reading...

343
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,998
...and I didn't fully understand it.

344
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,832
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

345
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,468
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

346
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,119
Which is...

347
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,952
...why I came to you.

348
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,073
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

349
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,754
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

350
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,074
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

351
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,710
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

352
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,949
Protected?

353
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,192
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

354
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,909
In other words, you cannot die.

355
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,837
And how does one split his soul, sir?

356
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,673
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

357
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,273
Murder.

358
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,034
Yes.

359
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,270
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

360
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,671
Can you only split the soul
once? For instance, isn't seven...?

361
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,273
Seven?

362
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,074
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

363
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,835
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

364
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,872
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

365
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,714
Of course, sir.

366
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,471
It'll be our little secret.

367
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,114
Sir.

368
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,916
This is beyond anything I imagined.

369
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,640
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

370
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,792
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

371
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,949
What are they exactly?

372
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,317
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

373
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,998
A ring, for example.

374
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,033
Or a book.

375
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,555
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

376
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,076
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

377
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,435
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

378
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,431
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

379
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,390
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

380
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,471
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

381
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,391
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

382
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,269
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

383
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,555
One destroys Voldemort.

384
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,518
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

385
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,797
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

386
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,997
...leaves traces.

387
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,471
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

388
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,835
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

389
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,598
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

390
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,673
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

391
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,631
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

392
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,635
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

393
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,314
...that you take too much for granted?

394
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,315
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

395
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,516
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

396
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:00,912
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

397
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,118
Oh, Harry.

398
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,830
You need a shave, my friend.

399
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,559
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

400
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,508
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

401
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,275
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

402
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,153
I'm an old man.

403
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,912
You still look the same to me, sir.

404
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,198
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

405
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,432
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

406
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,392
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

407
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,916
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

408
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,832
But there is one condition:

409
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,072
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

410
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,478
Yes, sir.

411
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,676
You do understand what I'm saying?

412
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,629
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

413
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,030
Should I tell you to run, you run.

414
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,034
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

415
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,513
Your word, Harry.

416
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,513
My word.

417
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,872
Take my arm.

418
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,549
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

419
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,510
Well, being me has its privileges.

420
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,398
This is the place.

421
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,673
Oh, yes.

422
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,028
This place has known magic.

423
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,199
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...

424
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,713
...payment must be made.

425
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,350
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

426
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,632
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

427
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,674
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

428
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,117
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

429
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,477
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

430
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,313
Careful.

431
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,949
There it is.

432
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,994
The only question is,
how do we get there?

433
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,032
If you would, Harry.

434
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,709
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

435
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,639
Oh, yes.

436
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,793
It has to be drunk.

437
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,679
All of it has to be drunk.

438
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,677
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?

439
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,149
This potion might paralyze me.

440
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,152
Might make me forget why I'm here.

441
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,071
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

442
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,151
You are not to indulge these requests.

443
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,710
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

444
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,235
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

445
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,716
- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?

446
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:49,079
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.

447
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,831
Your good health, Harry.

448
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,548
Professor.

449
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,749
Professor!

450
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,593
Harry.

451
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,149
Professor, can you hear me?

452
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,515
Professor.

453
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,389
No. Don't.

454
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,790
You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?

455
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,477
- Stop.
- It will stop. It will stop...

456
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,872
...but only if you keep drinking.
- Please, don't make me.

457
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,076
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Please.

458
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,435
- Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

459
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,315
It's my fault.

460
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,069
It's all my fault.

461
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,398
It's my fault.

462
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,791
Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise...

463
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,670
...I promise I'll do what you say.

464
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,592
- I promise.
- No.

465
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,919
Please.

466
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,479
Harry.

467
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,309
Water.

468
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,349
Water.

469
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,238
Water.

470
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,198
You did it, sir.

471
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,759
Look.

472
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,874
Harry.

473
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,474
Water.

474
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,752
<i>Aguamenti.</i>

475
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,359
Water.

476
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,359
<i>Lumos.</i>

477
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,471
<i>Lumos Maxima!</i>

478
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,312
Harry.

479
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,269
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

480
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,555
Harry.

481
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,038
<i>- Stupefy!</i>
- Harry.

482
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,028
Harry.

483
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,110
<i>Partis Temporus!</i>

484
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,912
Go to your houses. No dawdling.

485
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,629
We need to get you to the hospital
wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.

486
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,279
No.

487
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,840
Severus. Severus is who I need.

488
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,390
Wake him. Tell him what happened.

489
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,152
Speak to no one else.

490
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,876
Severus, Harry.

491
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,269
Hide yourself below, Harry.

492
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,558
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.

493
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,349
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.

494
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,712
Harry, do as I say.

495
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,428
Trust me.

496
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,519
Trust me.

497
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,992
Good evening, Draco.

498
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,230
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?

499
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,072
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

500
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:29,153
I often talk aloud to
myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.

501
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,919
Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?

502
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,719
Draco...

503
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,193
...you are no assassin.
- How do you know what I am?

504
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,078
I've done things that would shock you.

505
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,199
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in
return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?

506
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,874
Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?

507
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,553
Forgive me, Draco.

508
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,109
I cannot help feeling these actions
are so weak...

509
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,555
...your heart can't really
have been in them.

510
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,792
He trusts me. I was chosen.

511
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,158
Then I shall make it easy for you.

512
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,912
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

513
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,350
Very good. Very good.

514
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,439
You're not alone.

515
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,469
There are others.

516
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,793
How?

517
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,600
The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.

518
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,595
- I've been mending it.
- Let me guess.

519
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,593
It has a sister. A twin.

520
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,876
In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.

521
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,758
Ingenious.

522
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,594
Draco...

523
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,596
...years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

524
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,278
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help!

525
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,396
Don't you understand? I have to do this.

526
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,152
I have to kill you.

527
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,716
Or he's gonna kill me.

528
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,310
Well, look what we have here.

529
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,190
Well done, Draco.

530
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,472
Good evening, Bellatrix.

531
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,550
I think introductions
are in order, don't you?

532
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,635
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid
we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.

533
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,559
Do it.

534
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,759
He doesn't have the stomach,
just like his father.

535
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,593
Let me finish him in my own way.

536
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,230
No! The Dark Lord was clear,
the boy is to do it.

537
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,356
This is your moment. Do it.

538
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,751
Go on, Draco.

539
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,990
Now!

540
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,474
No.

541
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,359
Severus.

542
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,399
Please.

543
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,634
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

544
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,957
Yeah!

545
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,710
Hagrid! Hello?

546
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,759
Snape! He trusted you!

547
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,478
Go on.

548
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,758
<i>Incarcerous.</i>

549
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,480
Fight back! You coward, fight back!

550
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,112
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.

551
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,759
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

552
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,908
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?

553
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,755
Yes.

554
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,433
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

555
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,559
McGONAGALL:
Potter...

556
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,629
...in light of what has happened...

557
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,151
...if you should have the need
to talk to someone...

558
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,874
You should know,
Professor Dumbledore...

559
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,995
...you meant a great deal to him.

560
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,590
Do you think he would've done it?

561
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,557
Draco?

562
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,874
No.

563
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,956
No, he was lowering his wand.

564
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,837
In the end, it was Snape.

565
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,795
It was always Snape.

566
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,076
And I did nothing.

567
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,833
It's fake.

568
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,634
Open it.

569
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:16,034
"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead
long before you read this...

570
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,715
...but I want you to know that it was I
who discovered your secret.

571
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:24,389
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend
to destroy it as soon as I can.

572
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,472
I face death in the hope that
when you meet your match...

573
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,790
...you will be mortal once more.

574
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,632
R.A.B."

575
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,239
R.A.B.

576
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,828
Don't know.

577
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,320
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.

578
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,719
Which means it was all a waste.

579
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,433
All of it.

580
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,391
Ron's okay with it, you know.

581
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,313
You and Ginny.

582
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,469
But if I were you, when he's around,
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.

583
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,671
I'm not coming back, Hermione.

584
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,394
I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.

585
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,279
And I don't know where that'll lead me...

586
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,910
...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am when I can.

587
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,714
I've always admired your courage, Harry.

588
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,440
But sometimes, you can be really thick.

589
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,510
You don't really think
you're going to be able...

590
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,955
...to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?

591
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,632
You need us, Harry.

592
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,758
I never realized
how beautiful this place was.
